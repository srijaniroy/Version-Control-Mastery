### Question-wise Breakdown:

#### **Q1: Inventory Management System with Git ([Manav](https://github.com/Lord-Crow))**
- **Objective**: Design a system to manage products for a store. Customers can make purchases, and sellers can update the list of products.
- **Features**:
  - Added, updated, and deleted products using SQLite.
  - Maintained a list of products and allowed customers to purchase them.
  - Sellers can add, update, or delete products from the inventory.
  - Purchase history is tracked for customers.
- **Git usage**: Version control was used to maintain a history of changes to the inventory and purchase system.
  
#### **Q2: Marks Management System with Git ([Sayak](https://github.com/Sayak-77-sys))**
- **Objective**: Develop a Student Marks Management System where a central database stores students' marks for different subjects.
- **Features**:
  - Teachers can add, edit, and update marks for individual students in their subject.
  - The system tracks the roll number and name of students but allows teachers to edit only marks for their subject.
  - After all updates by teachers, the database is sorted by total marks and made available for students.
- **Git usage**: Git was used for version control to track updates by different teachers and ensure the integrity of the marks data.
  
#### **Q3: Task Management CLI Tool with Git ([Srijani](https://github.com/srijaniroy))**
- **Objective**: Develop a command-line task management tool where users can add, edit, and complete tasks.
- **Features**:
  - Tasks can be added, edited, marked as complete, and deleted.
  - Each task is tracked with a timestamp, and changes are recorded.
  - Version control ensures that task changes are logged and provides a history of task updates.
- **Git usage**: Version control is implemented to maintain the task history and track task changes over time.
- **Additional Work**: Srijani provided 10 data entries for both Q1 and Q2 to ensure the completeness of the project and for testing purposes.


### Additional Notes:
- This repository showcases the collaborative work done using version control with Git.
- Each team member contributed to different parts of the project, ensuring proper division of labor and efficient work management.
- The entire project is version-controlled and can be further extended or modified as needed.
